<h1>CNN-Based Plant Disease Detection</h1>
Overview
This project uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to detect plant diseases from images of leaves. The CNN model is trained on a dataset containing 10,000+ images of plants, spanning 38 different disease classes, to classify and detect plant diseases, aiding in early detection and efficient agricultural management.

<h2>Features</h2>
Disease Detection: Detects and classifies various plant diseases based on leaf images.
High Accuracy: Leverages CNNs for image classification and accurate disease identification.
Large Dataset: The model is trained on a dataset of over 10,000 images from 38 different disease classes.
